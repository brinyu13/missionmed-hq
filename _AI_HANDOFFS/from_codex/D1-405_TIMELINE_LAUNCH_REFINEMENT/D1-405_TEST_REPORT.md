# D1-405 Test Report

## M0 baseline

Starting commit: `771b8775b5007617335f7aface6e3772631a32d9`

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Functional TypeScript suite | 110/110 passed |
| Isolated performance suite | 9/9 passed |
| Browser/module suite | 320/320 passed |
| Typecheck | Passed |
| Package verification | 23/23 passed |
| Deterministic production build | Passed |

The production builder reported 185 files because it copied the ignored, user-owned `web/TimelineBuilder_v5.5_PreLaunch.html` alongside the canonical page. That copy is byte-identical to the restored canonical `web/index.html` at M0 and is not a D1-405 source authority. Production hardening will exclude the ignored copy from candidate packaging without deleting or modifying it.
