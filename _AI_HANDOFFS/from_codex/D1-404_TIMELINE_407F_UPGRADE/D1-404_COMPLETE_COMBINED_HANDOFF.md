## White-UXR halt

The prior white-shell runtime activation was halted because D1-404 explicitly
supersedes it. Its shell-agnostic logic, persistence, adapters, services, and tests
remain available as engineering sources, but `web/index.html` does not load
`web/js/app.js`, `web/styles.css`, `web/js/uxr-002/app.js`, or
`web/styles/uxr-002.css`.

## Milestone log

### M0 — canonical recovery

- Restored the exact canonical 407F bytes to the active runtime.
- Verified `http://127.0.0.1:8793/web/` in the in-app browser.
- Verified Home → Guided Builder → Home navigation.
- Console warnings/errors: 0.
- Test baseline: 371/371 (119 TypeScript + 252 module tests).
- Typecheck: pass.
- Package verification: 23/23.
- Screenshot:
  `screenshots/M0-canonical-407f-restored.png`
- Visual verdict: pass — immediately recognizable as canonical dark 407F.
- Commit: `d5126f8`

### M1 — four-destination 407F shell

- Reduced the canonical rail from 11 destinations to exactly Home, Builder,
  Canvas, and Export.
- Removed the XP/MP/level/avatar HUD, legacy header telemetry, Draft Status
  telemetry panel, and rail footer.
- Added the local `← Matrix` stub, preserved Timeline//S1 identity, added a
  live autosave state, and implemented zero-event Export disable semantics.
- Exposed one narrow 407F runtime seam and activated the shell-agnostic
  engineering adapter without loading the white UXR entry or stylesheet.
- Preserved prior local timeline data through the adapter.
- Browser rail/runtime assertion: pass.
- Console warnings/errors: 0.
- Test baseline: 374/374 (119 TypeScript + 255 module tests).
- Typecheck: pass.
- Package verification: 23/23.
- Screenshot:
  `screenshots/M1-four-destination-407f-shell.png`
- Visual verdict: pass — same dark 407F world, angular gold rail, premium depth,
  Archivo/Rajdhani character, and Keynote-derived energy.

## Precedence resolutions

1. D1-404 revokes the white/light shell direction but preserves the functional
   requirements and shell-agnostic engineering.
2. The canonical 407F `MM-CAM-THEME-D-001` tokens govern app chrome.
3. The original white-shell contrast addenda remain historical engineering evidence;
   new 407F work is independently contrast-tested against the dark theme.

## Founder decisions needed

None.
